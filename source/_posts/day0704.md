```python
## 확률적 경사 하강법
- 점진적 학습(step, 보폭)
- 학습률
- XGBoost, LightGBM, 딥러닝(이미지분류, 자연어처리, 옵티마이저)
```

###
- 신경망 이미지 데이터, 자연어
- 자율주행 하루 데이터 1TB --> 학습
- 한꺼번에 다 모델을 학습하기 어려움
 + 샘플링, 배치, 에포크, 오차가 가장 적은 지점을 찾아야 한다
- 결론적으로 확률적 경사 하강법

## 손실함수
- 로지스틱 손실함수

- 랜던포레스트, XGboost pamameters, 하이퍼파라미터 매우 많음

## 검증 세트
- 훈련세트와 테스트세트
- 훈련: 교과서 공부하는 것 훈련세트, 모의평가
- 검증: 강남대성 모의고사
- 테스트: 6월 / 9월
- 실전: 수능


```python
import pandas as pd
wine = pd.read_csv('https://bit.ly/wine_csv_data')
```


```python
data = wine[['alcohol','sugar','pH']].to_numpy()
target = wine['class'].to_numpy()

print("훈련성과",dt.score(sub_input, sub_target))
print("검증성과",dt.score(val_input, val_target))
print("마지막최종",dt.score(test_input, test_target))
```

    검증성과 0.864423076923077
    마지막최종 0.8569230769230769
    

## 교차검증
- 데이터셋을 반복 분할
- For loop
- 샘플링 편향적일 수 있음
- 교차검증을 한다고 해서, 정확도가 무조건 올라간다?(x)
- 모형을 안정적으로 만들어 준다
 + 과대 적합 방지 


```python
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold

df = np.array([1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10])

# 데이터를 K폴드로 나눈다
folds = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True)
for train_idx, valid_idx in folds.split(df):
  print(f'훈련데이터:{df[train_idx]},검증데이터:{df[valid_idx]}')
```

    훈련데이터:[ 2  3  5  6  7  8  9 10],검증데이터:[1 4]
    훈련데이터:[ 1  2  4  5  6  8  9 10],검증데이터:[3 7]
    훈련데이터:[ 1  2  3  4  6  7  9 10],검증데이터:[5 8]
    훈련데이터:[ 1  2  3  4  5  7  8 10],검증데이터:[6 9]
    훈련데이터:[1 3 4 5 6 7 8 9],검증데이터:[ 2 10]
    

- 교차검증 함수


```python
from sklearn.model_selection import cross_validate
scores = cross_validate(dt, train_input, train_target)
print(scores)
print("평균", np.mean(scores['test_score']))
```

    {'fit_time': array([0.01242208, 0.0106051 , 0.01989627, 0.01051641, 0.01058054]), 'score_time': array([0.00130367, 0.00125098, 0.0013361 , 0.00134611, 0.00127673]), 'test_score': array([0.86923077, 0.84615385, 0.87680462, 0.84889317, 0.83541867])}
    평균 0.855300214703487
    

- StratifiedKFold 사용 (이것까지 들어가면 좋은 코드)
- 참조할만한 좋은 코드를 찾는 것도 실력


```python

## 하이퍼 파라미터 튜닝
- 그리드 서치 (용어기억)
 + 사람이 수동적으로 입력
 + Max_Depth:[1,3,7]
- 랜덤 서치 (용어기억)
 + 사람이 범위만 지정
 + Max_Depth: 1-10 / by random 
- 베이지안 옵티마이제이션
- 사람의 개입 없이 하이퍼 파라미터 튜닝을 자동으로 수행하는 기술을 AutoML이라고 한다 
 + 예)PyCaret
- 각 모델마다 적게는 1-2개에서 , 많게는 5-6개의 매개변수를 제공한다
 + XGBoost 100개....?
- 하이퍼파라미터와 동시에 교차검증을 수행
 + 미친짓

교차검증 5번
교차검증 1회 실행시 Max Depth 3번 적용
- 총 결괏값 3 X 5 나온다

- Max Depth = 1,3,7
